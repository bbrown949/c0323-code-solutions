Condition is an expression that is tested each time the loop repeats. As long as condition is true, the loop keeps running.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
repeating the same process multiple times until a specific condition satisfies

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
it's executed once at the beginning of the loop.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
This expression is checked each time before the loop runs.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
The final expression is a statement that is executed at the end of each loop.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
break
