- What is React?
  React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.
- What is a React component?
  Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
